- **Console-Based Interaction:** Users can input commands to navigate the zoo and interact with animals.
- **Animal Sounds:** Each animal can make unique sounds.
- **Behavior Simulation:** Animals exhibit different behaviors when interacted with, such as swimming for Dolphins, roaring for Tigers, and waddling for Penguins.
